# ✈️-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Airline-Flights-Data
📊 Project Overview
This project performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on airline flight data to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and insights that impact flight behavior, pricing, and customer experience.

🔍 The goal is to:

Understand how different factors like departure time, airlines, source/destination, and stops influence flight duration and pricing.

Identify peak periods, cost-effective timings, and more using Python visualization tools.

🧠 Skills & Tools Used
Skillset	- Libraries Used
Data Manipulation	- pandas, numpy
Data Visualization	- matplotlib, seaborn
Exploratory Analysis	- Feature distributions, Outlier detection, Heatmaps, Grouping
Machine Learning Prep	- Null handling, Encoding, Correlation analysis

📌 Key Insights
✅ Duration Trends:

Evening flights tend to have longer average durations compared to early morning flights.

✅ Airline Pricing Patterns:

Some low-cost airlines have higher average ticket prices due to longer routes or multiple stops.

✅ Correlation Findings:

Number of stops and departure time have a strong impact on flight duration.

✅ Outlier Detection:

Boxplots were used to detect unusually priced tickets and abnormally long flights.

📈 Visualizations
Here are a few examples of the plots used in this analysis:

Bar Plot: Flight duration vs Departure time

Box Plot: Detecting outliers in pricing

Heatmap: Feature correlation matrix

Count Plot: Number of flights per airline


💡 Future Improvements
Apply clustering to group similar flight behaviors.

Build predictive models for price estimation.

Integrate real-time data for dynamic analysis.
